# tipCalculator

This project was created following a class on Udemy.  However, there were some caveats such as being able to create some local variables within the calculate()
function.  Also, using float was not ideal for calculating monetary values so, it was decided to use short instead of float.  

APK to be uploaded once the build has been completed.
